Description: tools for mounting an Ubuntu Touch rootfs
 This package contains the scripts to boot an Ubuntu Touch device.
 It also ships a default fstab that uses the android device paths based
 on partition label. By default it will mount the android userdata
 partition, then do a bind mount of the ubuntu subdir in there to become
 the root filesystem.
 .
 On failure the script will fire up an adb debugging shell
